I am currently a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in AI and Applications of AI in the [School of Computer Science](https://sheffield.ac.uk/cs) at the [University of Sheffield](https://sheffield.ac.uk/). Before joining Sheffield, I was a Lecturer in the Department of Computer Science at the [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/). I spent about 2.5 years as a Postdoctoral Researcher in reinforcement learning in the [Whiteson Research Lab](https://whirl.cs.ox.ac.uk/) at the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/), advised by [Shimon Whiteson](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/shimon.whiteson/). I was also a Non-Stipendiary Lecturer in Computer Science at [St Catherine's College](https://www.stcatz.ox.ac.uk/person/peng-bei/) at the University of Oxford. I received my doctorate from the [School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://school.eecs.wsu.edu/) at [Washington State University](https://wsu.edu/) in 2018, after working for five years at the [Intelligent Robot Learning Lab](https://irll.eecs.wsu.edu/) with my advisor [Matthew E. Taylor](https://drmatttaylor.net/). Before that, I worked as a front-end web developer in Tencent after receiving my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](http://english.hust.edu.cn/) in China in 2012.<br>

My research focuses mainly on (deep) reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems, interactive machine learning, and curriculum learning. My long-term research goal is to develop intelligent autonomous agents that can accomplish sequential decision-making tasks in complex uncertain and dynamic real-world environments, with or without humans in the loop. During my postdoc, I worked mainly on developing new deep multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms for discrete and continuous cooperative multi-agent tasks. My PhD research focuses on interactive machine learning and curriculum learning, where we study how non-expert humans want to teach the agent to solve new complex sequential decision making tasks and how to incorporate these insights into the development of new machine learning algorithms. 


**I am currently hiring a PhD student to work on reinforcement learning from human feedback. Feel free to email me if you are interested. Please include your CV and academic transcripts in the email.
