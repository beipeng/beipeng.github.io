I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in [Whiteson Research Lab](https://whirl.cs.ox.ac.uk/) at [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/), advised by [Shimon Whiteson](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/shimon.whiteson/). I'm also a Non-Stipendiary Lecturer in Computer Science at [St Catherine's College](https://www.stcatz.ox.ac.uk/person/peng-bei/) at University of Oxford. My current research mainly focuses on developing more sample-efficient deep multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms for discrete and continuous action domains. I'm also involved in some research projects about exploration in reinforcement learning and meta-learning. My PhD research mainly focuses on interactive machine learning and curriculum learning. I have done some work on exploring how non-expert humans want to teach the agent to solve new complex sequential decision tasks and how to incorporate these insights into the development of new machine learning algorithms. I received my doctorate from the [School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://school.eecs.wsu.edu/) at [Washington State University](https://wsu.edu/) in 2018, after working for five years at the [Intelligent Robot Learning Lab](https://irll.eecs.wsu.edu/) with my advisor [Matthew E. Taylor](https://drmatttaylor.net/). Before that, I worked as a front-end web developer in Tencent after receiving my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](http://english.hust.edu.cn/) in China in 2012.<br><br>
